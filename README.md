# Event Guest List Manager

This is a dynamic web application that allows users to manage a guest list for an event. Users can add, edit, and remove guests, categorize them, and track their RSVP statusâ€”all with a clean, responsive interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##  Features

###  Add Guest
- Users can input a guest's name and add it to the list.
- Prevents adding blank names with input validation.

### Guest Limit
- The list accepts a **maximum of 10 guests**.
- If the limit is reached, a user is alerted and no additional guests can be added.

###  Timestamp
- Each guest entry includes a timestamp of when they were added, formatted as the local time.

###  Edit Guest Name
- Each guest entry includes an **Edit** button.
- Clicking allows users to change the name using a prompt dialog.

###  Remove Guest
- Guests can be removed individually by clicking the **Remove** button.

###  RSVP Toggle
- A **"not attending" / "attending"** button lets users toggle RSVP status.
- Button label updates and status logs to the console.

###  (Optional) Category Tag (Friend, Family, Colleague)
- Designed to support categorizing guests (though UI styling may vary).
